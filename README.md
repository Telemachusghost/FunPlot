# FunPlot
Authors Derick Falk, Daniel Denniston, and Thomas Bowers

Created During Computation and Mindfulness at The Evergreen State College

Simple plotting program in python for plotting functions and sharing them with other users.

The emphasis on this project is fun and creativity. It uses its own drawing functions instead of using matplotlib or something similiar
; this is for educational purposes. You can draw python mathematical expressions on a canvas and then share these expressions with others that use the app through uploading the expression. You can see a list of expressions others have posted by downloading them. This project is very much just for fun and not intended for any type of real scientific inquiry. 

***Requires numpy and mysqlclient to be installed***
